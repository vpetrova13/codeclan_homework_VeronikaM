```{r}
library(tidyverse)
beer_data <- read_delim("data/beer.txt", delim = ";")
```
## Find all the observations where the carbohydrates are missing.
```{r}
beer_data %>% 
  filter(is.na(carbohydrates))
```
## Find all the observations where the brand is missing.
```{r}
beer_data %>% 
  filter(is.na(brand))
```
## What is different about the observations missing carbohydrates and the observations missing brand? To clean the data should be drop the rows missing brand or the rows missing carbohydrates?

Where brand is missing, almost all data is missing as well, thus can be easily dropped.
Where carbohydrates missed, there are still valuable information of brand, brewer, etc.
