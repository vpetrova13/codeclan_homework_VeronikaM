1. If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?
```{r}
dice_one <- rolldie(1)

dice_one %>% 
  dplyr::filter(X1 < 5) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(dice_one))
```
2. How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?
```{r}
dice_three <- rolldie(3)

dice_three

dice_perm <- as_tibble(
  permutations(
    n = 6,
    r = 3,
    v = c(1:6),
    repeats.allowed = TRUE
  )
)

nrow(dice_perm)
```
3. In an experiment where we roll four dice:

how many outcomes are in the event total_equals_5_6_7 (i.e. the total of the four dice equals 5
, 6
 or 7
)?
what is the probability of this event?
what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?
```{r}
dice_four <- rolldie(4) %>% 
  mutate(row = row_number())

dice_four
```
```{r}
total_equals_5_6_7 <- dice_four %>% 
  mutate(sum = X1 + X2 + X3 +X4) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(sum >= 5, sum <= 7)

total_equals_5_6_7
```
```{r}
prob_total_equals_567 <- nrow(total_equals_5_6_7) / nrow(dice_four)
prob_total_equals_567
```
4. Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?
```{r}
five_chairs <-  as_tibble(
  permutations(
    n = 5,
    r = 5,
    v = 1:5,
    repeats.allowed = FALSE
  )
)

five_chairs
1/nrow(five_chairs)
```
5. I roll six dice:

what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?
[Hint have a look at the isin() function in the prob package. For example, to filter all rows containing 6
, 1
, 2
 in that order, you could use isin(., c(6, 1, 2), ordered = TRUE)]
```{r}
six_dice <- rolldie(6) %>% 
  pull

six_dice_row <- as_tibble(
  permutations(
    n = 6,
    r = 6,
    v = six_dice,
    repeats.allowed = TRUE
  )
)

six_dice_row
  
```
```{r}
in_order <- six_dice_row %>% 
  isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = TRUE) 

sum(in_order)/nrow(six_dice_row)
```
```{r}
not_order <- six_dice_row %>% 
  isin(., c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = FALSE) 

sum(not_order)/nrow(six_dice_row)
```
6. If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades? 
 prob(A | B) = prob(A AND B) / prob(B) (conditional probability)
```{r}
prob_card_both <- 13/52
prob_card <- prob_card_both/ (26/52)
prob_card
```
```{r}
S <- cards(jokers = FALSE)

S <- S %>%
  mutate(black_card = suit == "Club" | suit == "Spade")

S_spades_and_black <- S %>%
  filter(black_card == TRUE & suit == "Spade")
prob_spades_and_black <- nrow(S_spades_and_black) / nrow(S)

S_black <- S %>%
  filter(black_card == TRUE)
prob_black <- nrow(S_black) / nrow(S)

prob_spades_given_black <- prob_spades_and_black / prob_black
prob_spades_given_black
```
7. Eight patients: Alice, Bob, Carmen, Dinesh, Ella, Fergus, Gianna and Henry are waiting to see a doctor, but only five appointment slots are left today.
```{r}
patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Carmen", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna", "Henry")

patiens_app <- as_tibble(
  permutations(
    n = 8,
    r = 5,
    v = patients,
    repeats.allowed = FALSE
  )
)

patiens_app
```
What is the probability of Gianna and Danesh both being seen today?
```{r}
prob_both <- patiens_app %>% 
  isin(., c("Gianna", "Dinesh"), ordered = FALSE) 

sum(prob_both) / nrow(patiens_app)
```
What is the probability of Gianna being seen before Dinesh today?
```{r}
prob_before <- patiens_app %>% 
  isin(., c("Gianna", "Dinesh"), ordered = TRUE) 

sum(prob_before) / nrow(patiens_app)
```
 Carmen and Henry have now been triaged as high priority and will be seen in the first two available slots, although their order hasnâ€™t yet been determined. In how many different orders can the patients now be seen?
```{r}
patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Carmen", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna", "Henry")

patients_high <- c("Carmen", "Henry")

patients_low <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna")


patiens_high <- as_tibble(
  permutations(
    n = 2,
    r = 2,
    v = patients_high,
    repeats.allowed = FALSE
  )
)

patiens_high

patiens_low <- as_tibble(
  permutations(
    n = 6,
    r = 3,
    v = patients_low,
    repeats.allowed = FALSE
  )
)

patiens_low
```
```{r}
high_priority_patients <- c("Carmen", "Henry")
S_high_priority <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 2, r = 2, v = high_priority_patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE))
names(S_high_priority) <- c("appt1", "appt2")

# second step is a 6P3 problem: permute 3 patients from 6.
normal_priority_patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna")
S_normal_priority <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 6, r = 3, v = normal_priority_patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE))
names(S_normal_priority) <-c("appt3", "appt4", "appt5")

# merge these dataframes
S <- merge(S_high_priority, S_normal_priority)
# final answer
nrow(S)
```



```{r}
patiens_high <- patiens_high %>%  
  rename(high = V1,
         high2 = V2)

patiens_low <- patiens_low %>%
  rename(low= V1,
         low2 = V2,
         low3 = V3)

both <- merge(patiens_high, patiens_low)
both
```
8. If order is not significant, how many ways are there to select a 5 student quiz team from a group of 8 students?
```{r}
as_tibble(
  combinations(
    n = 8,
    r = 5,
    v = 1:8,
    repeats.allowed = FALSE
  )
)
```
 9. (harder) How would your answer for question 8 change if a team captain had to be selected for each team?
```{r}
# step 1: choose a captain. We have 8 choices
num_captains <- 8

# step 2: for each choice of captain, choose 4 remaining team members from 7 
teams <- combinations(n = 7, r = 4, v = 1:7, repeats.allowed = FALSE)
num_team_combinations <- nrow(teams)

# combinations
num_captains * num_team_combinations
```
